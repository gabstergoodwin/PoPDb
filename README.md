Hello! Welcome to PopDb

Within Nebraska, there are hundreds of plants that are harmful to humans and livestock. Exposure for livestock is closely monitored but there is no easily accessible way to view exposure protocols for human exposure to potentially harmful plants. PoPDb, Poison Plants Database, is an accessible, primary relational database for poisonous plants commonly found in Nebraska that utilizes MySQL, HTML and PHP. Users enter a corresponding PlantID and PoPDb outputs geographical information and exposure information about the subject plant.
